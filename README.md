# Frontend Machine Coding Interview Projects

Welcome to the Frontend Machine Coding Interview Projects repository! This space is dedicated to sharing projects I've built to help others prepare for frontend coding interviews and machine coding rounds.

## Description

In this repository, you'll find a collection of frontend projects that showcase solutions to common coding challenges encountered during technical interviews or coding assessments. These projects cover various aspects of frontend development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frontend frameworks and libraries(I am using React JS).

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/mohit-ydv/Frontend-Machine-Coding-Questions.git


Navigate to the project directory and explore the available projects.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily focused on sharing my own projects, contributions are welcome! If you have a frontend coding project you'd like to share, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your project is well-documented and includes a clear problem statement, implementation details, and any necessary instructions or documentation.
